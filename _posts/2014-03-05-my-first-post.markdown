It used to be full of design and wotnot. Some of the work was old and crappy. Some of it was just old. I didn’t feel like much of it represented me any more.
The plan is to put a bunch of old writing on here and add to it when I think of something meaningful to say. I may add some visual stuff but mainly it will be on [zlbs.co](http://zlbs.co) or somewhere else, not sure. In the meantime feel free to tweet me at [@jonnyburch](http://twitter.com/jonnyburch).

I’ll also keep building and styling as I go along, how agile of me.
