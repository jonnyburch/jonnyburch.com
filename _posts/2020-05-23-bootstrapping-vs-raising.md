## 1. Introduction

A few people have asked me in the last couple of weeks about why I chose to self-fund Progression. As they will attest from my lack of response, It's really hard to answer that question simply.

To be honest, while we're still 'bootstrapped' as a business, my opinions have softened over the last year or so and I can definitely see advantages to both sides.

I have lots of friends who either work for or have raised money, most commonly from [angel investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/angelinvestor.asp) and [Venture Capitalists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp) – which I'll now refer to as VCs.

I've been a part of two VC-backed startups, [one](https://osper.com/) as the first employee (through seed and series A) and [the other](https://deliveroo.co.uk/) as 150th, watching as the team scaled to 2000 people. I'm a [scout for one VC](https://www.backed.vc/#scouts) and have counted [two](https://localglobe.vc/) [others](https://www.blossomcap.com/) as clients in the past.

Meanwhile my most listened-to podcast category is bootstrapped business (I'll link some of my faves later), and I completely subscribe to the opinion that you don't need investor money to build a business. I love the idea of working to live, and am more driven by the challenge of creating value from nothing than the ultimate scale of the value I create.

I reckon I'm pretty balanced.

So I figured, why not go through the process of listing questions I've asked to make my decision and the advantages and disadvantages of bootstrapping as I have seen them over the last year.

It's a good excise also to find all the articles I've read that most influenced me, and hopefully provide some guidance to those setting out on their entrepreneurial journey.

### An acknowledgement upfront

It's interesting reading the prevailing narrative around raising money and privilege. Raising money, historically and still today, is easier for white men. Investors — for the most part white men, but even when not — have biases towards white men. _[[source](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/35/17225.short?rss=1) [source](https://ratemyinvestor.com/pdfjs/full?file=%2FDiversityVCReport_Final.pdf&mod=article_inline)]_. It's harder to raise if you're black or brown, or female, or in any other minority group. There are fantastic people doing great work to change this, but it's going to take time.

But it's also a privilege to be able to _not raise_ and keep a fledgeling business going for this period of time. The only reason bootstrapping as a full time founder has been possible is due to a mixture of network and marketable skills. Put simply, I can sell my time expensively, by the day, and it's never been too difficult to find work.

That means that in 2019 I did about 25 days of paid work, which (with serious lifestyle changes and some product revenue) got me through the year.

So idea aside, for many this choice isn't a choice. I have supportive friends and family, no dependants and can buy myself time. I'm incredibly lucky. Please read the rest of this with that in mind – this is the lens of someone who can make the choice.

### Other assumptions

- I'm talking about 'going full-time' in this guide. If your intention is to run a side hustle or second income stream, raising money is likely not a consideration or option for you yet anyway.
- This article is most relevant to massively scaleable software businesses with high capital costs (to build the software) then very low marginal cost. Consultancies, low margin or geographically constrained businesses are going to need to think about this in a completely different way.
- The company I've started is B2B SaaS. Lots of other business models just wouldn't support either one or the other option. (in the same way that you wouldn't raise VC for a coffee shop or a consultancy, and you wouldn't bootstrap deep biotech or aerospace. More below.)
- I'm based in London which, while not the bay area, has a very vibrant startup ecosystem. [YMMV](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ymmv).
- All of this also assumes you have a good idea. A compelling problem to solve trumps all. If you can't succinctly describe your problem and customer, start there.
- This is, obviously, one person's opinion. Please tell me yours! (Honestly.)

## 2. What question are we answering?

To bootstrap or not to bootstrap.

Well first of all, let's define some terms.

### Definition of terms

**Bootstrapping** is when an entrepreneur (me!) starts a business with no outside capital or investments. [definition on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrapping.asp)

**Raising Money** is when an entrepreneur takes outside investment, That could be from Angels, VC, public markets (via an IPO), private equity or some other means. The most common methods for a software startup are through angels and VC funds, often in the form of 'funding rounds', where multiple investors gather together under a set of agreed terms and a company valuation and put money in in exchange for equity in the business. [What's the difference between a seed round and series A?](https://www.rocketspace.com/tech-startups/how-startup-funding-rounds-differ-seed-vs.-series-a)

### This doesn't need to be a final decision...

There's a wonderfully long list of bootstrapped companies [raising once, late on, at crazy valuations](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/in-its-first-funding-in-14-years-1password-raises-200m-series-a-led-by-accel/). If your company is healthy, with a clean cap table, investors will be interested.

In fact one of the current darlings of Silicon Valley, [Notion](https://notion.so), famously had to remove their company address from their website because they were getting so many cold approaches from VCs despite not being actively raising. They're now a [unicorn](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/).

Several companies have even [famously paid off their investors](https://wistia.com/learn/culture/taking-on-debt-to-grow-our-own-way) and moved to a sustainable business model from a high-growth one.

Remember though that it's easier to raise later than move to a self-funded model from a raise...

### ...and there's even a third option

One interesting model that has started to emerge for those who do want a capital injection but without getting on the fund raising treadmill is the 'bootstrapper' or 'indie' fund. Three prominent players in this space are:
- [Earnest Capital](https://earnestcapital.com/)
- [Indie VC](https://www.indie.vc/)
- [Tinyseed](https://tinyseed.com/)

They're all US based, selective and have differing terms and models but broadly the idea is that they operate on term sheets that support less risky, profitable and sustainable businesses by allowing the founders to pay them back – either by buying back their shares or not taking equity in the first place. Worth reading the fine print on each (especially if in the UK, where their terms won't play nice with SEIS/EIS).

While this is still in a nascent stage it does do a nice job of giving founders a way of taking money to achieve escape velocity, while not tying them in to an exit event in the future.

## 3. Questions for me, the entrepreneur

There are a few personal factors that should go into any decision around whether to raise money or not. These are _more_ important than business-level factors as you can't really control them.

### What am I optimising for?

I'd go as far as to say that this is the most important of all, and is probably the reason you're reading this in the first place.

Your business could go in two directions (assuming it goes to plan):
1. You build something small and beautiful that doesn't give you fame and doesn't change the world, but leads to a great financial outcome for you personally and a small team. You run the business without the pressure of investors, boards and public markets for as long as you want to, bringing in a fantastic salary until the day you sell for a healthy sum.
2. You build something that takes on a big market and wins. You work incredibly hard for 5-8 years, building a team of hundreds or thousands while sacrificing personal relationships and downtime, rub shoulders with your entrepreneurial heroes. You achieve the exit you dreamed of with a monster financial outcome that means you and your children will never want for anything ever again. Your speaker fees are very high.

The likelihood of these two outcomes are both low, to be clear. Most businesses achieve neither. But the first is significantly more likely than the second. So the trade-off is: more sensible business, smaller team, less glory and less of a dent in the universe, or 'go big or go home'?

Going big means a level of personal sacrifice (higher pressure), higher risk tolerance and also giving up a level of control in your own business — raise enough and your board will be able to vote you out.

But the big names and the richest people in the world didn't let that scare them. They went for it, and won big.

I've seen investor and 'raising the next round' pressure break people. But the alternative — I can tell you now — is far from stress free.

### Does it suit my own and my family's personal circumstances?

Can you actually support yourself for however many years it takes to get to a meaningful personal salary? If it takes 3 years, are you up for that? How about 4?

Putting yourself and your loved ones through months and years of reduced income is a serious decision. It may not feel like it in month 1-6 while you still have cash reserves, but sooner or later you're going to be making material sacrifices.

_An aside: you can definitely bootstrap alongside another income stream, but as I and many others have found, it's frustrating to have to do for any length of time, especially when you're pumped about your business. So assume you'll resent and want to quit any other job you have!_


### Am I going to need help and advice?

In short: have you done this before? Have you built products, or worked in teams building products? Do you have a reasonable understanding of how software works, how people market and sell?

Alongside the money, the other thing you're 'buying' with your equity is the experience and black books of your investors. An investor that can win you your first 3 enterprise sales, or find you a key hire, or give you their deep experience of a business model, is arguably worth way more.

I'm completely guilty of attempting to be a 'one man army', but other people who are incentivised to help you will give you massive shortcuts. That's why not all investors are equal. Pick and land the right investment and you'll be unstoppable.

The flipside of this of course, is you have more people to answer to. The time overhead of raising then updating investors takes meaningful time away from the team (typically the CEO, i.e. me!)

## 4. Questions for my business model

OK, so you've decided that for you personally, bootstrapping might be an option. But is your business actually suited to being self funded?

Being over-ambitious and getting stuck with no traction, or just picking a business model or sector that requires lots of capital to get to 'escape velocity' is something you really want to avoid. Planning and thinking through your business model upfront will help you to avoid this.

The following questions are far from a complete list, and there will undoubtedly be exceptions to all. But as a start list of prompts for thought, it's worth thinking about each critically.

### Can I get to meaningful revenue without too much capital?

<br>
<img src="/assets/img/journal/bootstrapping/tech-curve.jpg">
<br>
<small>The technology curve</small>
<br>
<br>

I went into my problem space (career growth at work is broken) with existing connections and avenues to explore. I'd even had the problem myself while growing designers in my previous role.

In short, I understood the space enough to know that the solution probably wouldn't involve as-yet undiscovered technologies. It was going to be a web app, at least in its first iterations. My background gave me a really strong understanding of how hard that would be to build then grow.

I also knew that even though I wasn't a professional developer, I could build enough to validate my initial assumptions completely solo.

Of course, you don't need to build it all yourself. But somehow, through either equity or cash, it needs to get built. So if you're non-technical and you can't make progress on your product solo, you'll either need to hire or pay consultants to do that for you or find a co-founder with that skillset.

It's worth also saying: Since I started, the no-code movement has exploded. Even if I couldn't write a line of code, I'd still have been able to make progress. There's no excuse not to start building your app code-free right now with resources like [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co/), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) or [Bubble](https://bubble.io/) providing your infrastructure.

If you can afford it and you're going the 'pay to get it built' route, a couple of tips:
- I strongly recommend finding and paying a few independent experts (technical pals) to talk through your idea with you to get an understanding of complexity, before engaging engineers or third party dev shops. Going into a big buying decision without that understanding is asking to get ripped off.
- Try and get to a user experience (click through app screens) yourself before approaching them. Tools like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) or even [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) are great for this. It will help them to understand what you need, and give you accurate estimates for both price and timescale.
- When you've designed what you want, cut half the features out, even if it's painful. Leave in only what you absolutely need.

If you want to find a co-founder, I wrote about my experience [here](/cofounder/).

The third option for getting to revenue is to start with a different revenue stream entirely. The first thing I started selling was effectively a book with a UI attached to it. No recurring revenue, but it taught me a lot. The crucial thing here though is that what you sell must validate your broader business, so has to be solving the same problem in some way.

### Can I get to meaningful revenue in a reasonable timeframe?

This one is about your [ARPU (Average revenue per user)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user) and go-to-market plan.

There's a very common mistake that bootstrappers seem to make, which is to pick a business model that means they can't charge very much per user, or can't charge anything at all (because they pick a market that people typically don't pay for).

This is a core reason why B2B SaaS is so popular amongst bootstrapped businesses. **Businesses pay more**. If you can sell your software for $49 a month, you only need 200 customers to get to the fairly arbitrary but popular first milestone of $10k Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). If you're charging $4.99, it will take you 2000 customers, and likely years.

If you're going freemium, you need to have a damn good reason to introduce your free tier first with no plans to monetise. You should at least be testing what people are willing to pay, and for what.

If your business relies on adoption of a free tool first, think deeply about how long you can survive with no revenue. If it's less than at least a year or two, keep the day job for a while or look to raise.

### Does the business model require scale to succeed?

Not all business models are equally able to grow gradually.

The canonical example of a business model that is hard to bootstrap is a social network. The value of a social network is the other people on it, so by definition it will only become valuable with a ton of users. Unless you have a captive audience ready to sign up on day one, it's going to be hard to retain your customers for long enough to make your product engaging.

Marketplaces are also notoriously difficult. A constant balance of supply and demand – unless you have one ready the other will disappear. Be very wary of attempting to bootstrap a marketplace unless you have an unfair advantage (see below).

In my opinion any software business where you don't have at least one revenue stream in mind for your first release is going to be challenging to bootstrap for any meaningful period of time.

Many say that in general B2C businesses are harder to bootstrap. Acquiring customers is harder, people are less willing to pay and have incredibly high expectations from the user experience.

So if you're going to need to get off the mark fast with lots of users, suppliers and activity, consider raising money. You'll need it for your marketing channels and to have a compelling product out of the gate.

### Does the market support multiple winners?

Similar to the above, but if your business requires a network effect to succeed, it's likely that you're in a winner-takes-all situation.

A historical example of this might be a company like Google. By building the search engine that won the search market, they were able to scrape more sites, train their algorithms and improve their search, improving product quality and attracting more searchers.

More searchers meant more advertising dollars, and the flywheel started spinning, racing them away from the competition. Anyone pitching to start a new search engine now would have to have incredibly deep pockets (see Bing) or be in a niche (see DuckDuckGo for security).

The best way to reduce the impact of this is to 'niche down' — pick a slice of that market with some specific needs and go after that. The problem if you're raising money becomes market size — is that niche big enough for a huge return on their investment?

(The market may be easily big enough for a bootstrapper to survive in though, without having to take market share off a 1 tonne gorilla.)

Much better though is to find a market that supports multiple winners.

Just like every coffee shop has a market consisting of the 500m around it, if your competitors have no network effect 'flywheel' at play it should be possible to co-exist.

_See [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/) vs [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for a good example of this._

To convince investors you'll need more than that though. You'll need a 'competitive moat' — a feature or aspect of your model that makes your business defensible against competitors. No, better UX isn't it.

You'll also need a 'Unique Selling Point' (USP), or compelling reason why you would be able to beat those competitors at their own game. Again, getting investment is all about believing that you're not just building a profitable business, but a very high valuation business. That relies on significant growth and market share.

### Do I have a captive audience, or do I need to buy one?

One massive advantage that lots of the well known bootstrappers underplay is their captive audience. If you have a popular podcast, or a community, or have been contributing to open source software for a decade, or are in some other way famous amongst your target customer, it's a huge advantage. That influence and reach is worth quite literally hundreds of thousands to millions in marketing spend.

Those people get that for free, and as a result have a better shot at reaching their market if their product is good.

If you don't have that, you need a plan for getting to your market. One of the biggest expenditures of funded startups is in customer acquisition, and it's something you need to be thinking about.

So. How big is your personal network? How many of your own customers do you personally know, or know you?

If you're not raising money, start building that list now. Don't wait for a product to launch. Contribute to communities, start that podcast, write that newsletter. You're going to need those people to offset your lack of paid marketing.

### Is it an existing or a new market?

One oft-talked-about topic in bootstrapping circles is whether the market you've chosen currently exists.

Folks like Justin Jackson use the analogy of selling ice creams on a busy beach to explain how it's easier to sell to an already captive market, who are used to paying and looking for a solution, than a new market that may not even be aware of the problem, let alone ready with their credit cards.

While there's definitely nuance to this, this is good advice for the most part. Even if there's already players in the space, as a small company if you take some customers from everyone you can build a great business without having to 'educate your market'.

More on our experience of this below.

## 5. My experience of bootstrapping

OK, now we have some basic answers, it's time to get going. This section covers some of the observations, frustrations and surprises I've experienced with bootstrapping [Progression](https://progressionapp.com).

Bear in mind:
- I did't have a fantastically large network of customers, but enough to get going
- I was not and remain not insta, twitter  or pod/blog-famous
- I started with few savings upfront but a way of earning as I went
- A year in I found Neil, my co-founder. As I write we're a team of two.

### Cashflow is stressful

There's no way around this one. We're paying ourselves small salaries, which of course puts pressure on our families and bank balances.

What's also interesting about this though, is that we're likely making decisions for the business based on those cash stressors.

One example might be our decision to build our 'check-ins' product. In order to charge more per customer, we wanted to get to a product that would provide value on a per user basis so we could charge per-user pricing.

That led us to an extra (I reckon) 6 months of development and testing time to get to a first meaningful release. Ironically by letting money lead the decision-making process, we ended up bloating that initial scope and wasting time.

**What if we raised?**

Raising money would at least provide us with a basic salary which would mean we could make the best decisions for the long term business (for example rolling out freemium if we thought it was strategically important) without worrying about whether it would raise next month's MRR.

### But we're our own bosses

The counterpoint to that cash stressor is that because we're our own bosses, if we have to do something unscaleable (like run workshops for customers) to bring in fast cash, we can. Sure, product velocity slows, but we live to fight another day.

During the COVID crisis we've taken the attitude of 'cockroach mode' – namely we won't die. As we're small with no salaried employees outside the directors and no promises made to investors, it's actually highly unlikely that we'd ever have to close the business. At worst, we'd work on it part time alongside other contracts.

Whether the life event is global like this one, or personal, it's really nice to know that we can tweak our ways of working to suit our needs.

**What if we raised?**

If we'd raised money and hired a team, we'd be having to talk about layoffs, pivots and hacking growth to raise our next round right now. Massive bullet dodged.

(In actuality we're not seeing too much effect from COVID and have chosen to launch! So go figure.)

### Things move slowly (or not at all)

No matter how many times I heard 'it's going to take a long time', I always thought I'd be that one magical unicorn who grew really fast.

Both underestimating the complexity of building a seemingly simple product and misunderstanding how easy it would be to get initial customers to pay meant that it's just taken a long time to get anywhere. I've been working on Progression for two years, and we just turned the public sign-ups on. As I said in [this post](/two-years-of-progressing), 2018 me would definitely have considered not doing it at all if he'd known where we'd be by now.

Josh Pigford from Baremetrics called this the 'long, slow SaaS ramp of death'. The journey to get to 'default alive' (enough money to become profitable) is slow and steady.

**What if we raised?**

Investor dollars would mean we could effectively put product and growth into overdrive through hiring growth people, engineers and putting cash into marketing and acquisition.

I would say that we as a team think about that trade-off at least every month. It's like we're making the bootstrapping decision again and again constantly as growth inches up.

### The value of advice

Neither Neil and I have built a successful B2B SaaS business before. This is neither of our first businesses but there's a wealth of stuff we don't know. Everything from sales and marketing to healthy metrics for product success are new synapses in our brains.

We both devour the internet/podcast streams for nuggets, but there's nothing like personal advice.

We've been lucky with some really engaged early customers and plenty of willing advice from smart people. But none of these people have completely aligned incentives with us.

Our customers want exclusively what works for them, not for the whole base, and volunteered advice is almost always lacking some context of our business (how much context can you give in a 1 hour coffee?) or from friends who don't want to offend.

The highest value advice and support would come from people with both the experience in our space, and the incentive to support us in our journey.

**What if we raised?**

Investors and equity-driven advisors, with skin in the game, want to see a return. This to me feels like a bigger value add to our business than cash itself, and is likely the main reason I would want to take money in the first place. The value of one or two key introductions and a few steers can save months and years.

### We keep a steady pace

At no point yet in the company's life has there been an 'oh fuck' moment. Again, COVID resulted in some conversations over how we react, and competitors entering the space have given us pause from time to time, but generally we plan our work then execute. No decisions need to be discussed outside our office, or presented to anyone.

**What if we raised?**

Investor updates, watching our burn, hacking growth to hit an arbitrary number and get the next round. Yeah, all that. Frankly the boom and bust nature of funded tech companies is the least appealing part of the whole journey for us.

### I'm having to be a jack of all trades

Not being able to hire experts is a big constraint. I've had to be at various times a salesman, marketer, customer support and success person and workshop facilitator as well as learning our code stack and writing thousands of lines of code, managing product backlog, working with partners on content and much more. Meanwhile Neil is deeply ingrained in our finances and everyday business operations alongside being the driving force behind product development.

As a designer and engineer founder combo, that's a lot of unfamiliar skills. None of it needs to be hugely sophisticated, but it's all context switching and being comfortable with the unfamiliar.

Luckily both of us love learning new skills and understanding how things work, so we're taking it on. That doesn't mean I don't fantasise about hiring community managers, full time editors, even a designer one day.

But being self funded means there's absolutely no guarantee of when that will happen, if at all. I may be doing customer support for a decade.

**What if we raised?**

With some cash, the first port of call would be hiring. Both engineering velocity and expertise in growth, or content, would take masses off my plate and free me up to be more strategic. It's deeply tempting. But really this is just a matter of time. If we achieve what we want to, we'll get there anyway.

### Educating our market

We've chosen to exist in a space with very few paid competitors. That's great because it's a [blue ocean](https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/what-is-blue-ocean-strategy/) with no competitors, but it also has thrown up issues.
1. We do have a customer, and they do have a problem and a budget to solve it. But they've never spent that budget on _software_ before.
2. As a result our biggest reason for not buying is and will continue to be 'I could do this in a spreadsheet'.

We've recently become aware of some competitors joining the space. The bootstrappers in us are celebrating – for every customer that they get into their products, we should win one too. The market will grow, and us with it.

**What if we raised?**

If we raised we'd have to tell a story of 'winning' the market. The level of growth we'd be going after would require a market maturing and us being the major player within it. Very doable and for us not frightening to say, but definitely a bigger challenge.

## 6. Conclusion

<small>The trade-off</small>
<br>
<br>

When you choose to bootstrap, you're fundamentally trading off initial slow growth and financial pressure upfront vs fast growth and pressure (from investors, employees and the market) later on.

To put another way, by raising money you're putting off the moment at which you have to be a real business. That means you can run unencumbered by personal runway, a need to immediately monetise your product.

### The two questions you shouldn't conflate

It's important to ask the two fundamental questions:
- What's right for me as a founder?
- What's right for the business I've chosen?

If you're a bootstrapper at heart attempting to build a business  backed by cash, you're going to find yourself beating your head against a wall unable to get the traction you need.

If on the other hand you want to build a fast growing, venture-backed business but your problem or market is best suited to bootstrapping you may find yourself unable to raise money (market too small) or if you do, unable to get revenue high enough for a good outcome. (See [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1w5R2PGCb4))

### Don't be dogmatic

The worst is the person who only thinks one thing. Bootstrap or die is boring, as is the valley-bro who sneers at lifestyle businesses.

The fact is that most of the world's economy has been built on businesses that haven't raised money using the venture model. Software means that one person can start a business from their bedroom and make a fantastic living.

For some, that's just not enough. To change the world in some ways, you need to take a big swing.

Both have their place. That's why you need to pick what feels right to you. You'll be way worse at the alternative.


## 7. Quick Comparison table

Warning, this is reductive, and not a check-list!

|Go bootstrapped if... |Go raise money if... |
|-|-|
|You can get to first revenue within a few months|You need to spend longer proving out the technology or other assumptions|
|All the technology you're using is known and buildable (by you or others)|Some or all of the technology is unknown or difficult to get right|
|Your product is valuable to an individual, using alone with no-one else in the system|Your product requires lots of users, suppliers or connections to succeed|
|Your market can support multiple winners|Your market is 'winner takes all' with e.g. a strong network effect|
|You have a captive audience through your personal network or brand|You don't know your first 100 customers, or how best to get to them|
|You like the idea of work life balance and family/personal life comes first|You want to put everything into this|
|You have years to try and make this work|You want to get to success or failure within 18-24 months|
|You definitely want to run your business forever|You definitely want to 'exit'|
|You have, or don't need, particular skills and contacts that will make your business a success|You need access and advice from others in order to succeed|
|Your market is proven, with several players already|Your market is unproven or nascent|


## 8. What next for us?

We're now at a stage where we're re-evaluating our strategy around fundraising. We don't have to raise — we're growing and profitable. But there's a big market here. The question is how big a dent we want to personally make in it.

The question that swirls in our minds is this one:

>_Is the business we've chosen to build most naturally a bootstrapped or a funded one?_

That remains a function of market size and our go-to-market strategy but also what we personally are up for committing to. Both need to be aligned in order for us to pull the trigger on a funding round.

The below is a vague list of lots of the reading I've found over the last couple of years. As I track these down (I've been bad at keeping lists) I'll add more.
