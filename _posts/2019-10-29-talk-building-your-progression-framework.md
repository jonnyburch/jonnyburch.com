I gave this talk to 600 attendees at [Jam London](https://www.makingjam.io) – a big room and amazing setting. It was really hard to write – surprisingly hard considering it's the subject I've been focusing on for so long.

I managed to fit in some stories about my mum and spreadsheets along the way. Enjoy!

The blurb:

_As humans we all want a successful, fulfilling career. But what does a ‘good’ career look like when we’re faced with an ever-changing set of technologies and a skillset that’s being defined under our feet? How do we know we’re focused on the right things?_

_Enter the spreadsheet._

_Product leaders across the world are using hand-made tools to define what ‘good’ looks like for their teams. They hope to help people feel like they know what’s expected of them and how to grow in the right direction._

_At Progression Jonny’s spent the last 18 months researching their efforts and looking for something better. He believes that a better way lies beyond the reach of any one company. To achieve career nirvana we all need to work together to build defining careers, not just jobs._

_Jonny will take you through his learnings and give you the tools to both map your team’s dream careers and follow your own._
