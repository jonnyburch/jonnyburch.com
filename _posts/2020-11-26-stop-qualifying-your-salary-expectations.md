Dear candidate.

I haven't been a hiring manager  (or on an interiew panel even) for about 2 years. It's been a long time since I had to ask anyone the dreaded question:

>#### 'What are your salary expectations?'

Even in my last role, that most often would have been asked by a recruiter as part of the phone screen stage before I swanned in.

But now I find myself [hiring again](https://progressionapp.com/careers) and remembering that part of the process, and being surprised by it all over again.

What are your salary expectations?

It's honestly a horrible question to ask, because I know how horrible a question it is to answer. No-one is having a great time in that moment. You're definitely not, and I'm not either.

But alas, it's a necessary part of an initial chat in order to save to-ing and fro-ing or wasting both your and our time with misaligned expectations later on.

So given I have had to ask, and you have had to answer, I've been asking and you have been answering.

And you're consistently terrible at answering the question. As I always have been.

It starts ok, with a number usually and a bunch of umming and ahhing.

But then you keep on talking. Mentioning your previous salary (I will never ask previous salary. I don't need to know. If someone asks you what your current/previous salary was, you don't need to tell them.) and how you could probably go a bit lower than that, but not much. How you understood we were a startup so could probably drop down a bit.

And I'm just thinking 'shhh stop!'. For the most part the number you've said is reasonable, and anyway we stated a salary range on our website. There's no need to say any more.

For such a crucial hire, we're looking for someone who is going to own an enormous part of our roadmap, business or strategy for a long long time. When we find the right person, we're all in. We don't get to make this hire twice.

So what we're not doing is making this decision based on a few thousand pounds this way or that.

>**The question we're really asking is not 'how much can we get away with paying you?', it's 'if we go through this process then make you the offer, will it turn out to have been a waste of your and our time?'.**

It's the same reason we'll ask about your timelines to move and work from home expectations.

We just want to know that we're in the same ballpark. We'll pay you what we believe you deserve, ideally beating whatever you said initially. If you got an offer, you're worth it.

It's really hard to just say numbers, especially when they mean something to you. More times than once I've had a wobble in my voice as I've talked salary with a manager or prospective employer. We're all shit at talking money, and of course unscrupulous hiring managers take advantage of that.

Just know that you don't have to tell people your current salary, and you shouldn't apologise for what you expect to be paid.
