I gave this talk for the first time at [Jam Barcelona](https://www.makingjam.io), to a lovely friendly crowd in an amazing church-like space. I compared the last 18 months of my life to a mountain I climbed with my friends on my stag do (Bachelor party) – with the false peaks and highs and lows entailed.

At the end I attempt to 'rap' along to The Sound of Music, for which I can only apologise.

The blurb:

_Jonny is a designer and the founder of Progression, a product focused on helping folks in tech teams to describe, map and grow their skills. Progression allows leaders to create flexible and industry-tested progression frameworks for current and future team members to measure themselves against._

_For the last seven years Jonny has led product design teams in tech. Most recently he scaled the consumer and growth groups at Deliveroo as the company grew from 150 to 2000 employees and 12 countries around the world._

_Having experienced first hand the pain of scaling teams fast, Jonny took the plunge from design leader to founder. In February 2018 he resigned from Deliveroo and launched Progression with the mission of helping to answer the age-old question ‘How do I grow at work?’._

_Since starting late last year – and with zero funding – he’s enlisted a number of London tech’s most celebrated design teams. But this is just the start._

_Next up? A future where anyone can build their skills with the same care and autonomy that they do their work. Better, fairer, more fulfilling careers for all._
