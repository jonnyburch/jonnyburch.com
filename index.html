# Hello, I'm Jonny.

I’m a designer from London. I work a lot on [Osper](http://osper.com), a little company with huge plans to change the face of finances for young people.

I’m also co-founder of [this agency](http://zlbs.co), which grew out of the side of a [magazine for graduate designers](http://shellsuitzombie.co.uk) that I started nearly five years ago now. It’s been quite a journey.

A while ago I also worked for some design agencies in London and Stockholm and even designed books for a bit. Which was nice.
