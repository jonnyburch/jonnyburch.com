<h3>I‚Äôm Jonny.</h3>

<p>I head up design at <a class="osper" href="https://osper.com" target="_blank">Osper</a>, where I'm helping to change the face of money management for young people, working across product, brand and marketing.</p>

<p>I also co-founded <a href="http://zlbs.co" target="_blank">a design agency</a> which grew out of the side of <a href="http://shellsuitzombie.co.uk" target="_blank">an angry magazine for graduate creatives</a> that I started years ago. Before that I worked for some agencies in London and Stockholm and even designed fancy books for a bit, which was nice.</p>

<p>Over the years I have, at various points, been fortunate enough to interview people like 
	{% for post in site.categories.interviews %}
	  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" itemprop="url">{{ post.menu_title }}</a>, 
	{% endfor %} etc. 
</p>
<p>
	I also occasionally write on <a href="https://medium.com/@jonnyburch" target="_blank">Medium</a> and talk at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-UX-Stories/" target="_blank">meetups</a>, <a href="http://www.pmn.co.uk/mex/speakers.shtml#burch" target="_blank">conferences</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FinTech-for-Humans/" class="ffh" target="_blank">wotnot</a>.
</p>

<h3>Let's talk!</h3>

I love a cracking email to break up the spam, especially if it contains an invite for ‚òï (or even üç≥)Ô∏è.
