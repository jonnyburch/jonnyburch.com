<h1>Whaaaaaaa</h1>

<p>I’m Jonny and stuff. I head up design at <a href="http://osper.com" target="_blank">Osper</a>, a little company with huge plans to change the face of finances for young people.</p>

<p>I’m also co-founder of <a href="http://zlbs.co" target="_blank">this agency</a>, which grew out of the side of a <a href="http://shellsuitzombie.co.uk" target="_blank">magazine for graduate designers</a> that I started nearly five years ago now. A while ago I also worked for some design agencies in London and Stockholm and even designed books for a bit, which was nice.</p>

<p>I also quite like to write, which is what this site is now for. I'm collecting various <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/notes" title="Notes">articles</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/interviews" title="Interviews">interviews</a> that I've penned over the last few years and sort of dumping them here, mainly for a larf.</p>

<p>Ooh, you can also ping me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jonnyburch" target="_blank">twitter</a> if you want to. Or don't, whatever.</p>

<p><small>You can also view all the code for this site <a href="https://github.com/jonnyburch/jonnyburch.github.io" target="_blank">here</a> if you super really care a lot. I'm not good at writing code though.</small></p>
