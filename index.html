    <p class="large"><b>I'm Jonny.</b> I'm a product designer, currently leading the consumer product design team at <a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk">Deliveroo</a> in sunny London. I enjoy the challenge of building <a href="http://startups.co.uk/deliveroo-uk-fastest-growing-tech-start-up-tech5-competition/" target="_blank">products (and teams) that scale</a> and searching for experiences that solve difficult problems.</p>

    <h4>A bit more about me</h4>

    <p>Previously I was first employee and led design for over three years at a bank for children. Before that I co-founded a design agency from the <a href="http://shellsuitzombie.co.uk" target="_blank">angry magazine for graduate creatives</a> that I started years before while working for agencies in London and Stockholm and even designing expensive books for a while. I've organised 30 day festivals in shipping containers, attempted to put out a live TV show in 4 hours and filmed people throwing meat at each other in slow motion. Confused yet? I am.</p>

    <h4>Writing, speaking, oh my!</h4>

    <p>I like to talk, and meet people I admire. As a result over the years I have interviewed people like   
      {% for post in site.categories.interviews %}
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" itemprop="url">{{ post.menu_title }}</a>, 
      {% endfor %} about everything from yoga to poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also write on <a href="https://medium.com/@jonnyburch" target="_blank">Medium</a> and talk at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-UX-Stories/" target="_blank">meetups</a>, <a href="http://www.pmn.co.uk/mex/speakers.shtml#burch" target="_blank">conferences</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FinTech-for-Humans/" class="ffh" target="_blank">wotnot</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Help me, help you</h4>

    <p>I really believe in the power of a good mentor, and am always looking for people to learn from or help out. So don't be shy, hit me up <a href="mailto:jonny@jonnyburch.com">by email </a>and let's do ‚òï (or even üç≥)Ô∏è.
