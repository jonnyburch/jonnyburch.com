<p>Iâ€™m Jonny. I head up design at <a href="https://osper.com" target="_blank">Osper</a>, where I'm helping to change the face of money management for young people.</p>

<p>I also co-founded <a href="http://zlbs.co" target="_blank">this design agency</a>, which grew out of the side of a <a href="http://shellsuitzombie.co.uk" target="_blank">magazine for graduate designers</a> that I started years ago. A while ago I also worked for some design agencies in London and Stockholm and even designed books for a bit, which was nice.</p>

<p>I have, at various points, interviewed

	  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" itemprop="url">{{ post.menu_title }}</a>, 
	{% endfor %}
 and more I'm sure. For the rest of my waffle there's Medium (below).</p>
