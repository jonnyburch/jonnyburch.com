<p>I’m Jonny. I head up design at <a href="https://osper.com" target="_blank">Osper</a>, a little company with huge plans to change the face of finances for young people.</p>

<p>I’m also co-founder of <a href="http://zlbs.co" target="_blank">this agency</a>, which grew out of the side of a <a href="http://shellsuitzombie.co.uk" target="_blank">magazine for graduate designers</a> that I started years ago. A while ago I also worked for some design agencies in London and Stockholm and even designed books for a bit, which was nice.</p>

<p>I'm in all <a href="https://instagram.com/jonnyburch/">the</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jonnyburch">usual</a> <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonnyburch">places</a>.</p>
