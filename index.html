    <h1 class="title">Hey buddy! It's me, Jonny.</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">I'm a co-founder of <a href="https://progressionapp.com">Progression</a>, a tech company building career development tools that people <i>actually want to use</i>. I know right?</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Before all that (amongst other things) I led consumer design at <a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk">Deliveroo</a> for a bit, helped to build a bank for children that made <a href="https://https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714436/Debit-card-lets-children-buy-porn-alcohol-weapons-blocked-thanks-Mail-Sunday.html">ahem, headlines</a>, published 6 issues and 15,000 copies of a <a href="https://shellsuitzombie.co.uk">sweary magazine for creative graduates</a> that my dad disapproved of and organised a <a href="https://vimeo.com/82980736">30 day creative festival</a> on a dime in boxpark. I also <a href="https://jonnyburch.com/goldie-interview/">interviewed Goldie</a> and watched him chainsaw a tree, which was nice.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">I can mainly be found online on <a href="https://twitter.com/jonnyburch">Twitter</a>, as of 2021 writing my newsletter <a href="https://500wordfounder.substack.com">The 500 Word Founder</a> or adding occasional longer musings and updates on my blog (see below).</p>
