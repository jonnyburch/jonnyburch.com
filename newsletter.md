## Join my newsletter

**I write a weekend newsletter of my thoughts, blog posts and observations, and you can get it directly to your inbox. Read with your sunday lunch!**

I'm on a wild journey at the moment, learning how to be a founder, a better human and build a business using technology and the internet. I also really like to stay close to my personal network â€“ together we're stronger.

The first folks on this newsletter were close friends, family and allies, and I consider you one too if you join.

If you reply, I'll reply. It gives me joy being able to have this conversation and learn openly.
So if that sounds like a bit of you, do sign up to be a part of my journey and this conversation.
